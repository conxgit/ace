/**
 * Workspace represents the modifiable client-side state of an ACE repository. It facilitates a workflow whereby a
 * repository can be checked out, queried, modified and committed back to the server.
 * <p>
 * Workspace has a generic API based on RepositoryObjects and their associations, as well as a more specific one dealing
 * with resource processors, artifacts, features, distributions and targets. The latter is mostly intended for
 * scripting, hence the shorthand notation of its method names:
 * <p>
 * Command syntax, first character is the "operation", then the "entity type" or "association". Note: not all
 * combinations exist.<br>
 * Operations: [c]reate, [l]ist, [d]elete, [u]pdate<br>
 * Entities: [a]rtifact, [f]eature, [d]istribution, [t]arget<br>
 * Associations: [a2f], [f2d], [d2t]<br>
 * <p>
 * Workspace objects are most commonly obtained from a WorkspaceManager acting on behalf of the client.
